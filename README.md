# LeaveHomeCompanion
A simple launcher app that launches LeaveHomeSafe by GovHK

# What it does
It simply opens LeaveHomeSafe if installed. This is packaged as an Android Launcher/ Home Screen app, so you only have to set it as your default "Home" app for it to work.

With this app, you can make your dedicated LeaveHomeSafe device launch LeaveHomeSafe whenever you press home or back
